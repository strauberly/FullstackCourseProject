# README #

This repository is a display of my work on a project as an assignment from Chad Darby of http://www.luv2code.com for a course I am taking and enjoying. The assignment is building an ecommerce application utilizing Angular for the  frontend and SpringBoot for the back and utilizes MySql WorkBench and sql scripts provided by Chad for creating the database. It is primarily written in TypeScipt with VSCodium.

This repository will be updated ittermittently with notes and progress updates.

All starter files and code provided by Chad Darby.

Future implementation: I intend to use what is learned here as a means to create an Angular application for managing reservations at a fuel dock for vessels of various size.
